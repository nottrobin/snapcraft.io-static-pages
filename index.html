                <h2>How do snaps work?</h2>
                <p>A snap is a fancy zip file containing an application together
                with its dependencies, and a description of how it should safely
                run on your system, especially the different ways it should
                talk to other software.</p>
                <p>Snaps are designed to be secure, sandboxed,
                containerised applications isolated from the underlying system
                and from other applications. Snaps allow the safe installation
                of apps from any vendor on mission critical devices and desktops.</p>

                <p>Try this: (you may need to <a href="/docs/core/install">install snapd</a>)</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block">
<code>$ sudo snap install hello-world</code></pre>

                <p>Now you have installed a snap. You can take a look inside the
                snap, since it is a new directory on your system:</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block">
<code>$ cd /snap/hello-world/current/

$ tree
.
├── <span class="directory-highlight">bin</span>                 ← this directory structure is just for convenience
│   ├── <span class="bin-highlight">echo</span>              there is no hardcoded structure requirement other
│   ├── <span class="bin-highlight">env</span>               than meta/snap.yaml
│   ├── <span class="bin-highlight">evil</span>
│   ├── <span class="bin-highlight">sh</span>
│   ├── <span class="bin-highlight">showdev</span>
│   └── <span class="bin-highlight">usehw</span>
└── <span class="directory-highlight">meta</span>                ← your snap must have this directory
    ├── <span class="image-highlight">icon.png</span>
    └── snap.yaml       ← this is the required metadata</code></pre>

                <p>So to create a snap, just put all the files you need
                into a directory, use whatever subdirectory structure you want. That
                directory will be compressed into a <dfn>squashfs</dfn> — a zipped directory —
                which will be mounted at
                <code class="command-inline">/snap/&lt;name&gt;/current</code> when
                the snap is installed. Your snap apps will know where they are mounted
                because that is provided as the
                <code class="command-inline">$SNAP</code> environment variable
                when they are run.</p>

                <p>The only requirement of a snap structure is that it
                contains a file called <code class="command-inline">meta/snap.yaml</code>, which describes security requirements
                and how the snap should integrate with other parts of the system.
                Let’s take a look at that <code class="command-inline">snap.yaml</code>
                for the <code class="command-inline">hello-world</code> snap:</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block">
<code>$ cat meta/snap.yaml
<span class="key-highlight">name:</span> hello-world
<span class="key-highlight">version:</span> 6.1
<span class="key-highlight">architectures:</span> [ all ]
<span class="key-highlight">summary:</span> <span class="string-highlight">"The 'hello-world' of snaps"</span>
<span class="key-highlight">description:</span> <span class="string-highlight">|
    This is a simple snap example that includes a few interesting binaries
    to demonstrate snaps and their confinement.
    * hello-world.env  - dump the env of commands run inside app sandbox
    * hello-world.evil - show how snappy sandboxes binaries
    * hello-world.sh   - enter interactive shell that runs in app sandbox
    * hello-world      - simply output text</span>
<span class="key-highlight">apps:</span>
  <span class="key-l2-highlight">env:</span>
    <span class="key-l3-highlight">command:</span> bin/env
  <span class="key-l2-highlight">evil:</span>
    <span class="key-l3-highlight">command:</span> bin/evil
  <span class="key-l2-highlight">sh:</span>
    <span class="key-l3-highlight">command:</span> bin/sh
  <span class="key-l2-highlight">hello-world:</span>
    <span class="key-l3-highlight">command:</span> bin/echo</code></pre>

                <p>The initial metadata describes the snap. The <code class="command-inline">version</code> is purely for humans; the snap system
                won’t ever treat it as special or try to compare versions
                between snaps.</p>

                <p>Next is a list of “apps” provided by this snap. Each app
                is explicitly named (“<code class="command-inline">env</code>”, “<code class="command-inline">evil</code>”, ‘<code class="command-inline">sh</code>”, and “<code class="command-inline">hello-world</code>”) and each
                gets a distinctive command, which is path relative to <code class="command-inline">$SNAP</code>. The name
                of the app doesn’t have to match the command.</p>
                <p>The special app here is “<code class="command-inline">hello-world</code>”, because it has the same name
                as the snap itself. This makes it the default app in the snap, so you can run
                it just by typing “<code class="command-inline">hello-world</code>” after the snap is installed. The others
                need to be namespaced, so “<code class="command-inline">hello-world.evil</code>” will execute the <code class="command-inline">bin/evil</code>
                command in the snap.</p>
                <p>A snap can declare daemons to be started as well. This one just
                describes some apps.</p>

                <h3>Snaps are read-only and have segregated data stores</h3>
                <p>Snaps are read-only for security. The aim is to prevent a hostile
                party from sneakily changing the software on your machine, so you
                cannot modify a snap that is installed on your system. This also
                means you can always check the signature on the snap, even long
                after you installed it, to make sure it is still exactly the
                software you intended. If you want to modify a snap, you can
                usually build your own version of it, especially if it is open
                source.</p>
                <p>So where can a snap write data? Each snap gets its own set of
                writable directories which have specific properties. There are
                two directories which the snap can write to independent of the
                user. One of these is versioned: each time the snap is upgraded
                the data is saved and the new snap revision can upgrade its copy.
                The other common data directory is not versioned, and is used
                for big blobs of data that you don’t want to duplicate across
                revisions of the snap:</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block">
<code>/var/snap/&lt;name&gt;/current/  ← $SNAP_DATA is the versioned snap data directory
/var/snap/&lt;name&gt;/common/   ← $SNAP_COMMON will not be versioned on upgrades</code></pre>

                <p>Typically, configuration is stored in one of these, along with
                system-wide data for the snap.</p>

                <p>There are an equivalent two writable directories for each
                snap in the user’s home directory, which can be used to store snap data
                specific to that user:</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block">
<code>~/snap/&lt;name&gt;/current/      ← $SNAP_USER_DATA that can be rolled back
~/snap/&lt;name&gt;/common/       ← $SNAP_USER_COMMON unversioned user-specific data</code></pre>

                <p>This way applications can be immutable for security reasons,
               while still offering a full and rich user experience. To learn
               more about the makeup of a snap please see the
               <a href="/docs/snaps/structure">snap
               architecture article.</a></p>

                <h3>Snap integration with interfaces, plugs and slots</h3>
                <p> Snaps are safely confined in their separate sandboxes by
                sophisticated kernel security mechanisms. That means that snaps
                can’t peek at your data — other than the data you give
                them — if they are compromised or malicious. But what if you need your snap
                to talk to another snap? For example, what if your snap needs to
                talk to a database?</p>
                <p>It can use “interfaces” — standard and well-defined ways to
                provide and consume services from one another. Snaps can offer
                “slots” to provide services, and declare “plugs” that connect
                to other snap slots to consume those services. Imagine two snaps
                A and B that need to talk to each other:</p>

                <p class="diagram">
                    <img src="{{ site.asset_path }}74bd0daf-interfaces-+plugs-and-slots.svg" />
                </p>

                <p class="complementing-note">These two snaps can be connected because they have a plug
                and a slot with a matching interface.</p>

                <p>The interfaces are declared in the <code class="command-inline">snap.yaml</code> metadata:</p>
                <p class="diagram">
                    <img src="{{ site.asset_path }}1c1706c0-Update-Snapcraft%28dot%29io+-+YAML+metadata.svg" />
                </p>

                <p>There are <a class="external" href="/docs/reference/interfaces">
                many interfaces defined</a> that can be used by
                snap developers to describe the ways their snaps should be
                connected. A snap can be connected to the host system OS
                using plugs, too, which is how it can access shared user
                documents or other services like OpenGL.</p>

                <p>Snaps can share files with other snaps from the same vendor,
                or with community-maintained shared snaps which act as libraries
                of common data or code, for
                example using the content-sharing interface. This reduces duplication while still ensuring rigorous
                security and update control.</p>

                <p>When you install a snap, the system will automatically connect
                up the standard, safe plugs and slots. For example, your new game
                will automatically get access to the OpenGL libraries on your
                system because that’s considered normal behaviour for a game.
                But there may be other plugs and slots you can connect up by
                choice, and  snaps will document those individually.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="snapcraft_home_how-snaps-work_architecture" class="eight-col">
                <h3>The architecture of a snappy system</h3>
                <p>So a snappy system has a collection of snaps, each of which
                is read-only, each of which has its own set of independent
                writable directories, and each of which can talk to other snaps
                and the host OS through a set of plugs and slots with matching
                interfaces.</p>

                </p>

                <p>The snap system will present all the snap apps under <code class="command-inline">/snap/bin/</code>,
                so with that on your <code class="command-inline">$PATH</code> you can easily run snap commands. It
                will also integrate all the snap daemons (services) with your
                init system so that they are automatically started and stopped
                as needed.</p>

                call these the ‘promoted’ snaps, and you can search them for a
                matching name:</p>



<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ snap find hello
Name         Version  Developer  Notes  Summary
hello        2.10     canonical  -      GNU Hello, the "hello world" snap
hello-huge   1.0      noise      -      A really big snap
hello-world  6.1      canonical  -      Hello world example</code></pre>

                <p>In the future, you will be able to refine <code class="command-inline">snap find</code> queries with more parameters.</p>

                <p>These examples use the Ubuntu store; your snap implementation
                might be different. Other stores are available, and it’s easy
                to create your own. There is an open-source
                <a class="external" href="https://github.com/noise/snapstore">simple snap store</a>
                implementation to get you started making your own store.</p>

                <p>We’ll start by installing GNU Hello, from the Free Software Foundation:</p>

                <pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ sudo snap install hello</code></pre>

                <p>Just like any other app, we can then launch the snap  from the
                command line, or from the desktop if it has a launcher:</p>


<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ hello
Hello, world!</code></pre>

                <p>See the snaps installed on your system with “<code class="command-inline">snap list</code>”, which
                will also tell you the software version, the unique revision, the
                developer of the installed snap, and any extra information such
                as whether the snap is in <a href="/docs/reference/confinement">developer mode</a> or not:</p>


<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ snap list

                <p>Snaps are updated automatically in the background every day.
                You can manually get the latest version of all your snaps with
                “<code class="command-inline">snap refresh</code>”, which will bring you completely up to date for all
                snaps, unless you specify particular snaps to refresh.</p>

            <div id="snapcraft_home_using-snaps_channels" class="eight-col">
                <h3>Stable, candidate, beta and edge channels</h3>
                <p>Developers can release stable, candidate, beta and edge versions
                of a snap, at the same time, to engage with a community who are
                willing to test upcoming changes. You decide how close to the
                leading edge you want to be.</p>

                <p>By default, snaps are installed from the “<code class="command-inline">stable</code>” channel. By convention,
                developers use the “<code class="command-inline">candidate</code>” channel to provide a heads-up of
                a new stable revision, putting it in “<code class="command-inline">candidate</code>” a few days before
                “<code class="command-inline">stable</code>” so that people can test it out. The “<code class="command-inline">beta</code>” channel is for
                unfinished but interesting milestones, and the “<code class="command-inline">edge</code>” channel is
                conventionally used for regular or daily development builds that
                have passed some lightweight smoke-testing.</p>


<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ sudo snap refresh hello --channel=beta
hello (beta) 1.2 installed</code></pre>

                <p>Now, you can run the beta version of the snap:</p>


<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ hello
Hello, snap padawan!</code></pre>

                <p>You can also install a snap from the “<code class="command-inline">beta</code>” channel directly:</p>


<pre class="command-line code-block"><code>$ sudo snap install hello --beta
Hello (beta) 1.2 installed</code></pre>
