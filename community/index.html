            <p>Whether you want to snap your own app or an established open source
            application, you’ll find plenty of help here. Joining the growing
            community of Snappy developers is as simple as signing up to a <a class="external" href="https://lists.snapcraft.io/mailman/listinfo/snapcraft">mailing
            list</a> or have some fun in the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/ubuntu/snappy-playpen">Snappy Playpen.</a></p>
            <p>Interacting with the Snappy community can be useful in other ways,
            too. It can help you attract new users for your app, and it can be a
            great way to start contributing to the platform’s most popular projects.</p>
